# Dailymotion Downloader (Browser Extension)

> Download supported Dailymotion videos as MP4 files for offline viewing.

Dailymotion Downloader is a browser extension for users who want a cleaner way to save Dailymotion videos without relying on browser hacks, screen capture workarounds, or generic tools that miss the real stream. It detects supported Dailymotion media, lets you choose the available quality, and exports the result as MP4 for later playback.

- Detect available quality levels exposed by the player
- Export MP4 files for easier playback across devices
- Keep a browser-first workflow instead of manual extraction
- Use a cleaner offline workflow for channels, references, and archives

## Why Dailymotion Downloader

Dailymotion videos are often delivered through player-managed sources rather than a simple static file you can right-click and save. That makes casual download attempts inconsistent. Some generic extensions detect nothing, while others fail to surface the actual playback quality you want.

Dailymotion Downloader is built to simplify that flow. Open the video, let the extension detect the active media source, choose the available quality, and save the result as MP4 from within the browser.

## Features

- Detects supported Dailymotion streams from active video pages
- Lists quality variants when multiple resolutions are available (1080p, 720p, 480p, 360p, 240p)
- Converts HLS streams to downloadable MP4 files in-browser
- Video info card with thumbnail, title, duration, and video ID
- Right-click context menu for a faster download flow
- Real-time progress tracking with download speed and file size
- Desktop notifications when downloads complete
- Auto-saves to an organized DAILYMOTION subfolder in Downloads
- Exports MP4 files for easier offline viewing
- Cross-browser support for Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera, Firefox, Whale, and Yandex

## How It Works

1. Install the extension from the latest release.
2. Open a Dailymotion video page and press play.
3. Let the extension detect the active media source.
4. Open the popup or use the right-click context menu.
5. Review the video info card and available quality levels.
6. Choose the resolution you want and start the download.
7. Save the final MP4 file locally.

## Step-by-Step Tutorial: How to Download Videos from Dailymotion

1. Install Dailymotion Downloader from the latest GitHub release.
2. Open Dailymotion and sign in if the page requires account access.
3. Navigate to the video page you want to keep.
4. Let the player load fully and press play.
5. Click the extension icon in your toolbar or right-click the page.
6. Review the video info card and quality options shown by the extension.
7. Choose the resolution you want if more than one option is available.
8. Start the download and wait for the MP4 export to finish.
9. Open the saved file from your Downloads folder.

## Supported Formats

- Input: supported Dailymotion video streams (HLS and direct HTTP)
- Input: multiple quality levels (typically 1080p, 720p, 480p, 360p, 240p)
- Output: MP4

Saved files use MP4 so they are easier to replay on standard media players, transfer between devices, or archive for later access.

## Who It's For

- Dailymotion viewers who want offline copies of supported videos
- Users archiving public or authorized reference material
- People who want a browser extension instead of manual media extraction
- Users saving videos for travel, review, or internal reference
- Content creators who need to archive their own uploaded videos

## Common Use Cases

- Save a Dailymotion video for later playback
- Export the highest available quality as MP4
- Keep a local copy of reference material for offline access
- Avoid using manual screen recording for simple downloads
- Archive your own uploaded content from Dailymotion

## Troubleshooting

**The extension does not detect the video**
Press play first and wait a few seconds for the player to initialize the active source.

**No quality picker appears**
Some pages expose only one playable stream, so only one option may be available.

**The page looks loaded but the extension is empty**
Refresh the page and retry after starting playback again. Make sure the URL contains /video/.

**The download stopped or failed partway through**
Check whether your internet connection dropped during the export. Retry the download from the popup.

**The extension does not work on an embedded Dailymotion video**
Navigate to the original Dailymotion.com video page first, then use the extension from there.

## Security & Scope

- Operates only on the page the user intentionally opens in the active browser tab
- Detects supported playback sources only for user-initiated downloads or exports
- Does not execute page instructions, shell commands, or arbitrary scripts from page content
- Does not follow unrelated links or perform actions outside the active workflow
- Limits support to the named platform, approved embedded contexts, and user-authorized sessions when required

## Trial & Access

- Includes **3 free downloads** so you can test the workflow first
- Email sign-in uses secure one-time password verification
- No credit card required for the trial
