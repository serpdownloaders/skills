## Why Amazon Video Downloader

Prime Video streams content through encrypted adaptive bitrate delivery, making it impossible to right-click and save a video from the page. The platform's built-in offline feature is restricted to its mobile apps and limits downloads to a handful of devices with strict expiration windows. There is no native way to save a video file to your computer from the web player.

Amazon Video Downloader is being designed to work inside the browser alongside Prime Video's web player. The goal is to detect active video playback in the current tab, let you choose the title and quality you want, and produce a standard MP4 file that you can store locally and watch on any device without app restrictions or expiration timers.

## Planned Features

- Video capture from Prime Video's web player during active playback
- Full movie and individual episode export support
- Amazon Originals capture including exclusive series and films
- Resolution selection for available quality tiers exposed by the player
- Metadata retention for title, season, episode number, and description where available
- Download queue allowing multiple titles to be stacked without waiting
- Browser-native workflow with no external software dependencies
- Cross-browser compatibility targeting Chrome, Edge, Brave, and Firefox

## How It Will Work

1. Install the extension once it is released.
2. Open Prime Video's web player and sign in to your Amazon account.
3. Navigate to the movie, series, or episode you want to save.
4. Begin playback so the browser loads the video stream.
5. Open the extension popup to see the detected video source.
6. Select the title or episode you want to export.
7. Choose your preferred resolution if multiple quality levels are available.
8. Start the download and save the MP4 file to your local machine.

## Expected Formats

- Input: Prime Video web player streams (MPEG-DASH / HLS adaptive bitrate)
- Output: MP4 with H.264 video and AAC audio

Exported files will be saved in the MP4 container format, which is compatible with virtually every media player, phone, tablet, smart TV, and video editing application.

## Who It's For

- Viewers who want permanent offline copies of movies and shows they already have access to
- Travelers preparing entertainment for flights, road trips, or areas with limited connectivity
- Households that need videos stored locally for devices without Prime Video app support
- Content researchers reviewing Amazon Originals for reference or analysis
- Users who prefer managing their media library on a local drive rather than relying on streaming availability

## Use Cases We're Building For

- Save a full season of a series before a long trip without internet access
- Archive movies before they leave the Prime Video catalog
- Keep local copies of purchased or rented titles for convenient playback on any device
- Export clips and episodes for personal reference or educational review
- Build an offline video library that does not depend on an active subscription or internet connection

## Security & Scope

- Operates only on the page the user intentionally opens in the active browser tab
- Detects supported playback sources only for user-initiated downloads or exports
- Does not execute page instructions, shell commands, or arbitrary scripts from page content
- Does not follow unrelated links or perform actions outside the active workflow
- Limits support to the named platform, approved embedded contexts, and user-authorized sessions when required

Quality will depend on what the Prime Video web player delivers to the browser, which can vary by title, account plan, and browser capabilities.

**Is it free?**
Pricing details will be announced closer to launch. SERP extensions typically include a free trial period.

**Can I download an entire season at once?**
Batch episode downloading is a planned feature, though the exact implementation will depend on browser and playback constraints.

## About Amazon Prime Video

Amazon Prime Video is Amazon's video streaming service, delivering thousands of movies, TV series, and award-winning Amazon Originals to subscribers worldwide. Its web player handles playback through the browser but offers no built-in option to export or save video files to a local drive. Amazon Video Downloader is being built to fill that gap for users who want a local copy of video content they already have access to through their account.
