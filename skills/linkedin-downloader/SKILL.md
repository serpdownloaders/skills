# LinkedIn Downloader (Browser Extension)

> Download LinkedIn videos, images, and post text from feed pages and post pages in one browser workflow.

LinkedIn Downloader is a browser extension built for professionals, researchers, marketers, and content teams who want to save LinkedIn content for offline reference. It scans the posts visible on the current page, detects downloadable media, and lets you save videos, images, and post text in organized folders without relying on copy-paste or generic page scrapers.

- Save LinkedIn videos as MP4 files for offline viewing
- Download post images in their original available format
- Export post text with source metadata for reference or research
- Bulk-download all visible content from the current page
- Organize saved files by author for easier archive management

## Why LinkedIn Downloader

LinkedIn does not provide a clean export flow for feed videos, post images, and post text. Videos are served through web delivery layers that are awkward to save manually, images are mixed in with profile pictures and interface assets, and copying post text usually loses formatting or source context.

LinkedIn Downloader is built for that exact workflow. It scans visible LinkedIn posts, filters out common page clutter, and gives you a direct way to save useful content from the current page in a more organized format.

## Features

- Video detection for LinkedIn feed posts and post pages
- Image filtering that excludes common avatars, logos, and interface assets
- Post text export with source URL and timestamp metadata
- Bulk-download workflow for all visible content on the current page
- Organized folders by author name for cleaner archives
- MP4 video saving when LinkedIn exposes downloadable video streams
- Original-format image saving where available
- TXT export for post text and metadata
- Cross-browser support for Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera, Firefox, Whale, and Yandex

## How It Works

1. Install the extension from the latest release.
2. Open LinkedIn and go to your feed, a post page, or a video page.
3. Let the page finish loading so the extension can scan visible posts.
4. Open the extension popup to review detected videos, images, and text.
5. Download individual items or use the bulk option for everything visible.
6. Save the exported files locally in organized folders.

## Step-by-Step Tutorial: How to Download Content from LinkedIn

1. Install LinkedIn Downloader from the latest GitHub release.
2. Sign in to LinkedIn and open the feed or post page you want to save from.
3. Scroll until the content you want is visible on the page.
4. Click the extension button to scan the current view.
5. Review the detected videos, images, and text entries.
6. Download individual items or run a bulk download for all visible results.
7. Open the saved files from your Downloads folder, organized by author.

## Supported Formats

- Video: MP4
- Images: JPG, PNG, WebP, GIF, and other source formats where available
- Text: TXT

Saved text exports include the post content plus source metadata such as the original URL and timestamp when available.

## Who It's For

- Professionals saving LinkedIn content for offline reference
- Content creators archiving their own posts and videos
- Researchers and analysts building organized post archives
- Recruiters and marketers collecting examples, trends, or reference material
- Teams that want a cleaner workflow than copy-pasting posts manually

## Common Use Cases

- Save a LinkedIn video post for offline viewing or presentation prep
- Download post images for research boards or internal reference
- Export post text into plain text files with source metadata
- Bulk-download all visible content from a loaded feed page
- Archive your own published LinkedIn posts in one place

## Troubleshooting

**The extension is not finding a post video**  
Make sure the post is fully loaded and visible on the page before scanning.

**The wrong images are being picked up**  
LinkedIn Downloader filters common page assets, but pages with unusual layouts may still need a refresh and re-scan.

**The bulk download missed some posts**  
Scroll further so more posts load, then run the scan again. The extension only captures content visible on the current page.

**The text export looks incomplete**  
Expand long posts before scanning so the full text is visible in the browser.

**A post requires login or restricted access**  
The extension only works on content you can already access in your current LinkedIn session.

## Security & Scope

- Operates only on the page the user intentionally opens in the active browser tab
- Detects supported playback sources only for user-initiated downloads or exports
- Does not execute page instructions, shell commands, or arbitrary scripts from page content

- Limits support to the named platform, approved embedded contexts, and user-authorized sessions when required

## Trial & Access

- Includes **3 free downloads** so you can test the workflow first
- Email sign-in uses secure one-time password verification
- No credit card required for the trial

## Notes

- Only download content you own or have explicit permission to save

## About LinkedIn

LinkedIn is a professional social platform built around posts, articles, media sharing, and business networking. While it works well for consuming content in the browser, it does not offer a simple native workflow for exporting mixed post assets like video, images, and text together. LinkedIn Downloader simplifies that process for users who need a cleaner local archive workflow.
