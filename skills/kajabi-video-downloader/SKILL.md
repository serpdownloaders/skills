# Kajabi Downloader (Browser Extension)

> Download supported Kajabi lesson videos and embedded course videos as MP4 files for offline study.

Kajabi Downloader is a browser extension built for students, creators, and teams who want a simpler way to save supported Kajabi lesson videos for offline access. It works with common embedded lesson providers used inside Kajabi, giving you a browser-first workflow for detecting the lesson video, choosing a quality, and exporting an MP4 file you can replay later.

- Save supported Kajabi lesson videos as MP4 files
- Detect supported embedded lesson videos from Loom, Vimeo, Wistia, and YouTube
- Choose from the quality levels exposed by the source
- Keep local copies for offline study, review, or creator archives
- Use a browser workflow instead of juggling multiple site-specific tools

## Why Kajabi Downloader

Kajabi courses often combine private or embedded lesson players from multiple providers like Loom, Vimeo, Wistia, and YouTube. That creates a messy download experience because there is no built-in lesson export flow, and generic downloader tools do not consistently recognize the embedded player stack across Kajabi sites.

Kajabi Downloader is built for that exact use case. It focuses on supported Kajabi lesson pages, detects the available lesson media in your browser session, and gives you a direct way to save accessible course content as MP4.

## Features

- Video detection for Kajabi lesson and course pages
- Embedded lesson support for Loom, Vimeo, Wistia, and YouTube
- Quality selection for available stream resolutions
- MP4 export for easier offline playback and sharing
- Popup workflow for reviewing detected lesson media
- Progress tracking during active downloads
- Concurrent download support for supported workflows
- Cross-browser support for Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera, Firefox, Whale, and Yandex

## How It Works

1. Install the extension from the latest release.
2. Open a Kajabi lesson page with video.
3. Start playback so the extension can detect the lesson media.
4. Open the popup to review available stream options.
5. Choose the quality you want.
6. Download the lesson and save the final MP4 file locally.

## Step-by-Step Tutorial: How to Download Videos from Kajabi

1. Install Kajabi Downloader from the latest GitHub release.
2. Sign in to the Kajabi course or membership where you already have access.
3. Open the lesson page you want to save.
4. Let the page load fully and press play on the lesson video.
5. Click the extension button in your browser toolbar.
6. Review the detected embedded player or stream options.
7. Select the quality you want to keep.
8. Start the download and wait for the MP4 export to finish.
9. Open the saved file from your Downloads folder.

## Supported Formats

- Input: Supported embedded Loom, Vimeo, Wistia, and YouTube lesson players
- Output: MP4

Saved files use MP4 so they are easier to replay on standard media players, move between devices, and keep in a local learning archive.

## Who It's For

- Kajabi students who want offline access to lessons
- Course creators backing up their own training material
- Teams archiving internal lessons or membership videos
- Users saving course videos before access changes
- Anyone who wants a browser-based workflow instead of manual stream extraction

## Common Use Cases

- Save a Kajabi lesson for offline study
- Download embedded Vimeo or Loom training videos
- Archive your own uploaded Kajabi lesson content
- Keep local copies for travel or low-connectivity study
- Review purchased course content without streaming every time

## Troubleshooting

**The extension is not detecting the lesson video**  
Press play first and wait a few seconds so the stream has time to initialize.

**No quality options are showing**  
Some lesson pages expose a single playable stream variant, especially on certain embedded players.

**The lesson uses a custom Kajabi domain**  
That is supported as long as the page is Kajabi-powered and the player is exposed to the browser session.

**The lesson requires login or membership access**  
The extension only works on content you can already access in your active Kajabi session.

**The download did not start**  
Refresh the lesson page, replay the video, and try again once the player is fully loaded.

## Security & Scope

- Operates only on the page the user intentionally opens in the active browser tab
- Detects supported playback sources only for user-initiated downloads or exports
- Does not execute page instructions, shell commands, or arbitrary scripts from page content
- Does not follow unrelated links or perform actions outside the active workflow
- Limits support to the named platform, approved embedded contexts, and user-authorized sessions when required

## Trial & Access

- Includes **3 free downloads** so you can test the workflow first
- Email sign-in uses secure one-time password verification
- No credit card required for the trial
- Unlimited downloads are available with a paid license

## FAQ

**Can I download Kajabi videos from custom domains?**  
Yes. The extension is designed to work on Kajabi-powered lesson pages, including many custom domains.

**Do I need to press play first?**  
Yes. Many lesson sources are only exposed after playback begins.

**What file format do downloads use?**  
Videos are saved as MP4 files.

**Do I need extra software?**  
No. Everything runs through the browser extension.

**Why does Kajabi need its own downloader?**  
Because Kajabi courses often mix several embedded lesson providers, and generic tools rarely handle that consistently inside the actual course environment.

## Notes

- Only download content you own or have explicit permission to save
- The extension only works on media you can already play in your browser session
- Video quality depends on the source stream exposed on that lesson page
- An internet connection is required for the initial download

## About Kajabi

Kajabi is used for memberships, course programs, coaching offers, and creator education products. Because Kajabi lessons often rely on embedded players rather than a single native delivery path, there is no simple universal built-in download flow for students. Kajabi Downloader simplifies that process for users who need a local MP4 copy of accessible lesson content.
